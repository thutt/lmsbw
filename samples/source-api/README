This sample implements two components:

  o producer

    This component declares a data structure and an API to access the
    data structure.  Changing the defined source API will cause the
    'consumer' component to be rebuilt.

  o consumer

    The 'consumer' component includes and uses the source API as
    defined by the 'producer' component.  Any changes to the exported
    API will cause the 'consumer' to be rebuilt.

The 'run-sample' script will execute lmsbw with all the proper command
line options to invoke the local configuration.

Any additional command line parameters are passed directly to lmsbw.

For example, try the following:

   ./run-sample
   ./run-sample log
   ./run-sample report
   ./run-sample targets
   ./run-sample dependent-report
   ./run-sample prerequisite-report

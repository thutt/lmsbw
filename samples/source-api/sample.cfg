# This sample implements two components:
#
#   o producer
#
#     This component declares a data structure and an API to access
#     the data structure.  Changing the defined source API will cause the
#     'consumer' component to be rebuilt.
#
#  o consumer
#
#     The 'consumer' component includes and uses the source API as
#     defined by the 'producer' component.  Any changes to the
#     exported API will cause the 'consumer' to be rebuilt.
#

# load_configuration <pathname of configuration file declaring this function>
#
# The loaded configuration files use 'CURRENT_CONFIGURATION_FILE' to
# associate the loaded components with their configuration file.  This
# information is important for depdnency check; change the config file
# and its build process will be invoked.

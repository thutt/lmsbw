This very simple sample demonstrates how an adapter can be used to
adapt LMSBW output to a different build system's build directory.

It was created by cloning the 'hello-world' sample.

The 'run-sample' script will execute lmsbw with all the proper command
line options to invoke the local configuration.

Any additional command line parameters are passed directly to lmsbw.

For example, try:

   ./run-sample
   ./run-sample log.hello-world
   ./run-sample report
   ./run-sample targets
   ./run-sample dependent-report
   ./run-sample prerequisite-report

The build output is placed into /tmp/hello-world

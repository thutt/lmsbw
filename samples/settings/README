This very simple sample shows how to use 'global-settings' and
'local-settings'.  It creates three global settings:

  CFLAGS
  VERSION
  PROJECT

In the 'hello-world' component, 'CFLAGS' is overridden with a local
setting.

In the 'goodbye-world' component, 'VERSION' is overriden with a local
setting.

The value for 'PROJECT' is passed intact to all components.

The 'run-sample' script will execute lmsbw with all the proper command
line options to invoke the local configuration.

Any additional command line parameters are passed directly to lmsbw.

For example, try:

   ./run-sample
   ./run-sample log.hello-world
   ./run-sample report
   ./run-sample targets
   ./run-sample dependent-report
   ./run-sample prerequisite-report

The build output is place into /tmp/sample

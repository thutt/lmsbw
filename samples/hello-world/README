This very simple sample creates two components, one of reason 'build',
and one of 'image'.

The 'run-sample' script will execute lmsbw with all the proper command
line options to invoke the local configuration.

Any additional command line parameters are passed directly to lmsbw.

For example, try:

   ./run-sample
   ./run-sample log.hello-world
   ./run-sample report
   ./run-sample targets
   ./run-sample dependent-report
   ./run-sample prerequisite-report

The build output is place into /tmp/hello-world

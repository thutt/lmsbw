This sample demonstrates a method of component configuration that
loads all components  and dynamically configures them based on the
value of environment variables.

See the 'lite-consumer-pro' sample for a method of configuring
components using symlinks.

This sample configures the set of included components based on the
environment variable 'BALL_CLASSIFICATION', which can have one of the
following values:

    fuzzy
    hard
    large
    round
    small
    soft

If a ball's categorization matches the current setting of
'BALL_CLASSIFICATION', then the component is included in the build.
If it does not meet the classification, then it is not included.

A component will be provided a unique build directory for each
classification it matchs.  For example, a 'golf' ball would match the
'hard' and 'small' classifications, and a build for 'hard' would be
afforded a different build directory than a build for 'small'.

Execute the classification programs in the 'scripts' directory to see
an example of how this manner of configuration works.

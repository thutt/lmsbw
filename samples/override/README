This sample creates two components which override the default
component 'build' and 'install' targets.

The 'run-sample' script will execute lmsbw with all the proper command
line options to invoke the local configuration.

Any additional command line parameters are passed directly to lmsbw.

For example, try the following:

   ./run-sample
   ./run-sample log
   ./run-sample report
   ./run-sample targets
   ./run-sample dependent-report
   ./run-sample prerequisite-report

The build output is placed in /tmp/override

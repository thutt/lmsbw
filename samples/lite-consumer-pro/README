This sample shows how to configure several different products using
symlinks to component configuration files.

The component configuration files are stored in 'components', while
the configuration symlinks for the three different products -- lite,
consumer, pro -- are stored in 'products'.

The 'run-sample' script will execute lmsbw with all the proper command
line options to invoke the local configuration.

Any additional command line parameters are passed directly to lmsbw.

For example, try the following for each product

   ./run-sample
   ./run-sample log
   ./run-sample report
   ./run-sample targets
   ./run-sample dependent-report
   ./run-sample prerequisite-report

To run this sample, you must select which product you want to build
and export the environment variable 'PRODUCT' set to one of:

   lite
   consumer
   pro

To interact with the 'lite' product:

   PRODUCT=lite ./run-sample

To interact with the 'consumer' product:

   PRODUCT=consumer ./run-sample

To interact with the 'pro' product:

   PRODUCT=pro ./run-sample


The build output is placed in /tmp/product

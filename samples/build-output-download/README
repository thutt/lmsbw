This sample provides a reference for the ability to have components
that are not built by a local developer, but instead have the output
of the component build process downloaded from a central build server
and installed into the build directories.

This can save time for large projects with components that take a very
long time to build and are infrequently changed.

From the viewpoint of the developer that uses the build system, there
is no change to their workflow.

The build team, however, needs to provide an official 'build server'
to build these 'download' components, and they need to provide a
script that downloads the build from the server and installs it into
the build directory.

This sample provides an example of a script which will download the
proper build output and install it into the build directory.  See the
LMSBW reference manual for the semantics that the script must follow.

This sample has two modes of operation: 'build-server' and
'developer'.

The 'build-server' mode will build the components and create archives
of the build output for components marked to have the build output
downloaded.

The 'developer' mode will download the pre-built archives of the
download components.

There are several ways basic ways that this sample can be run:

  o 'developer' first, 'build-server' second, 'developer' third

     This will demonstrate the failure that the build cannot be found,
     and then it will correctly function.

  o 'build-server' first, 'developer' second

    This will demonstrate that the build works correctly.

After the build has been created and is downloadable, you can also
modify the sources for the components and build with 'developer' mode
to see that the system will not be able to find a bulid that
corresponds to the current state of the source tree.

To run, execute one of the following:

  ./run-sample build-server
  ./run-sample developer

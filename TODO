 o Sharing interfaces between between 'build' and 'image' components must
   be disallowed.  The compilers may be different, and their set of
   include directories should not intersect.

   The directories do not intersect, but LMSBW cannot prevent a
   'image' component from using the API of an 'image' component, nor
   vice versa.  This must be documented, instead.  Indeed, this cannot
   be prevented because a 'build' component should set it's executable
   directory as the API so that any time the executable changes, all
   dependent component's builds will be invoked.

 o Add new target which reports on build space used per component
 o document that component.makefile is run in the directory where the
   configuration file is stored.  XXX Is this still true?
 o If debugging enabled, component.makefile should warn on undefined
   variables.
 o Add lmsbw_ prefix to functions
 o Error messages should print component names for disambiguation.
 o Figure out why generate-rules.mk causes errors when put in
   lmsbw-system.mk.
 o Figure out why error occurs if assignment to __dsm in declare_source_component() is removed.
 o Document that global toolchain settings can be harmful when cross
   compiling.  Components built for use in the build process will be
   built with the global compiler, and thus be unusable.
 o Document LMSBW_C_TOOLCHAINS_ROOT, and LMSBW_C_TOOLCHAIN
 o Support LDFLAGS wrapping per-component.
 o Document that subordinate Makefiles must not refer to absolute pathnames.
   This will violate the rule that the source is inviolable, and messes up
   all checking of source directory changes using mtree.
 o Document that the install directory for a project uses the full
   pathname of the configuration file in the hash.  If you have
   projects with different SKUs, but the SKUs have exactly the same
   components, only with compile-time differences in the components,
   you can force different install directories by having different
   configuration files.
 o One could imagine an extension to the component system.  A plugin
   for subdirectory makefiles which would has CFLAGS, the relative
   pathname and the contents of the source file.  The hash would be
   sent to an official build server asking if an object file for that
   configuration exists on the build server.  If it does, the object
   file is returned.  If it does not exist, then it should be built
   locally.
 o Applying patches should be part of lmsbw
 o 'build' component cannot be dependent on 'image' components.

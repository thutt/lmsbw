 o Need way to indicate where the install mtree manifest is located
   via lmsbwe.  Or, LMSBW_configuration associative array.
 o Allow multiple configuration files.
 o Sharing interfaces between between 'build' and 'image' modules out
   to be disallowed.  The compilers may be different, and their set of
   include directories should not intersect.
 o Add new target which reports on build space used per component
 o Provide module.makefile a mechanism to select a toolchain, and to
   get it installed.
 o document that module.makefile is run in the directory where the
   configuration file is stored.
 o If debugging enabled, module.make should warn on undefined
   variables.
 o Could Make command line options in lmsbw_expand_build_module() be
   put into a text file in the build directory and included by
   module.makefile?
 o Need to be able to specify include directories in the install
   directory so that modules can use them.  Or, should this be in the
   module Makefile?
 o Need to be able to specify an API to be exported from a module.
   This API will be checked in the install directory during building
   of dependent modules; if they are different, then rebuild
   dependents after cleaning them.  A full rebuild on API changes is
   caused by rsync not preserving the timestamps.  Replace '--times'
   with '--ignore-times' on the rsync command line.

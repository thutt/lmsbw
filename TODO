 o Need way to indicate where the install mtree manifest is located
   via lmsbwe.  Or, LMSBW_configuration associative array.
 o Allow multiple configuration files.
 o Sharing interfaces between between 'build' and 'image' components must
   to be disallowed.  The compilers may be different, and their set of
   include directories should not intersect.
 o Add new target which reports on build space used per component
 o document that component.makefile is run in the directory where the
   configuration file is stored.
 o If debugging enabled, component.makefile should warn on undefined
   variables.
 o Need to be able to specify include directories in the install
   directory so that components can use them.  Or, should this be in
   the component.makefile?  This boils down being able to install
   things in a standard directory structure that is automatically
   accessible to all components.  CFLAGS could be pre-populated with
   "-I<install-sysroot>/usr/include".
 o What about Windows toolchains?
 o Document that if no toolchain is set, the host toolchain is used.
 o Add lmsbw_ prefix to functions
 o document declare_source_component
 o document declare_component_install_target
 o document declare_component_build_target
 o document declare_component_api
 o document each file of LMSBW_<component>
 o Document all errors
 o Need document on adding a new 'kind' of component.
 o Add 'gdb' verb to load a component's binary output in gdb.
 o Remove TARBALL repository.
 o Document overriding component rules, such as 'install' for cases
   when the component does not have an 'install' rule.
 o The help message for lmsbw is horrible.
 o Document how to override the build & install & configure rules.
   Look for 'chap:overriding' in variables.tex
 o Error messages should print component names for disambiguation.
 o Figure out why generate-rules.mk causes errors when put in
   lmsbw-system.mk.
 o Document component.makefile-specific defines are LMSBW_C_<id>.
 o Document that global toolchain settings can be harmful when cross
   compiling.  Components built for use in the build process will be
   built with the global compiler, and thus be unusable.
 o Document toolchain macros CC, GXX, et al.
 o Install directory should be unique for toolchain?  If global, yes.
   If not global, no.
 o Document LMSBW_C_TOOLCHAINS_ROOT, and LMSBW_C_TOOLCHAIN
 o Support LDFLAGS wrapping per-component.
 o Figure out why error occurs if assignment to __dsm in declare_source_component() is removed.
 o Would using a SHA  the source-api-mtree-manifest make it more robust?
   (No way to change API, and change it back and *not* rebuild
   everything; must clean dependent components...)
 o Remove documentation for component 'source-api-changed' field.

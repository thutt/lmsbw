# This uses mtree to check a manifest against a provided directory
# tree.
#
# It returns 0 if directory tree is the same as the manifest, and
# non-zero if the directory tree differs at all from the manifest.
#
# It is used to guard the execution of commands using the contents of
# the directory.  If the directory contents have not been changed, the
# guarded statements will not be executed.
#
# An example use is this:
#
#   If nothing has been modified in a source subdirectory of a
#   component, there is no reason to invoke the component's build
#   process to do a NULL build.

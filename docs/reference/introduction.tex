\chapter{Introduction}

Recursive use of \make has fallen out of favor since the publication
of \emph{Recursive Make Considered Harmful}
(\texttt{http://aegis.sourceforge.net/auug97.pdf}), but in real-world
situations, recursive \make is still dominant because \make provides
no support for creating a maintainable non-recursive build system.

Rather than trying to change the world by convincing people to
increase the complexity of their build system with non-recursive use
of \make, the software described in this document aims to simplify the
world by implementing a wrapper system -- implemented entirely in
\gnumake and \texttt{bash} scripts -- which allows the continued use
of a recursive \make system, but provides dramatic performance
improvements by only recursing when something in the source tree has
changed and without requiring widespread changes to the existing build
process.

The following tenets guided the implementation of \lmsbw:

\begin{itemize}
\item Incremental Builds

  \lmsbw was developed with a team of developers in mind, and from that
  perspective the day of a developer involves many small changes and
  rebuilds of the software.  The key focus of \lmsbw is to ensure that
  incremental builds are as fast as possible.

  To achieve such speed, in simple terms, \lmsbw will never recurse
  into a sub-directory unless something in the corresponding source
  tree has changed.  This is accomplished by using the \mtree utility.

\item Disk Space

  Disk space is free relative to the cost of a developer: the amount
  of time wasted by developers performing administrative tasks around
  their build \& build output is a giant productivity drain.

  \lmsbw saves time by compromising on space.  Trading off increased
  disk space for improved developer productivity is the right choice
  to reduce product development cost.

\item Source Is Immutable

  \lmsbw is a general wrapper for build systems, and generally
  speaking, each build system performs differently: some write all
  output data into the source directory, while others write to a
  user-specified build directory.

  Partially due to the unknown behavior of wrapped builds, \lmsbw has
  been designed to consider the source directory tree to be immutable.
  Further, to reduce the complexity of the implementation of \lmsbw,
  as well as to guarantee correctness, \lmsbw has been written to
  clone the original source directory into the build directory.

  The upshot of this is that the original source directory will never
  be sullied by \lmsbw, nor the wrapped build process.  Another
  benefit of having an immutable source tree is that it is easy to use
  different toolchains -- perhaps for cross compiling to another
  operating system or architecture -- without having to retool the
  original build process.

\item Uniform Interface

  \lmsbw has been designed to make it easy to wrap an existing build
  process.  In concept, declare each \emph{component}, usually a
  source directory containing a \makefile, to \lmsbw.  Declaration
  includes information about the directory and options for building
  it, including which other components are prerequisites.

  \lmsbw compiles this information and generates, on-the-fly, a set of
  \make rules and targets which allows the wrapped build process to be
  executed.

  Included in the generation of rules and targets is a uniform
  interface: to produce a build report for all components, just
  execute the \texttt{report} verb (\xref{usinglmsbw:report}), but it
  can also be executed on a particular component with this syntax:
  \texttt{report.dailyprocessing}.

  Similarly, many other \emph{verbs} (\xref{lmsbw:target:verbs}) which
  are exported by \lmsbw can be executed globally or on an individual
  component.

\item Extensible

  \lmsbw has been designed to be easily extended with new types of
  components.  See \xref{chap:extending}.
\end{itemize}

\section{What Benefit Will \lmsbw Provide?}

At this point there may be interest, but also reticence to invest a
lot of time just to find out if \lmsbw will provide a speed benefit.
Fortunately, there is a way to quickly determine if \lmsbw will
provide a benefit, because this package has a handy script which will
provide benchmark numbers.  Just follow these instructions:

\begin{itemize}
\item Download \& extract \lmsbw sources

\item Set environment variable

  Set \texttt{ld} to the full pathname of the directory to which
  \lmsbw was extracted.

\item Test Speed

\begin{verbatim}
  ${ld}/scripts/lmsbw-mtree-speed-test   \
     <source directory>...
\end{verbatim}

  The command will execute the \mtree utility on each directory named
  on the command line, and then output the elapsed time for processing
  all the directories.

\end{itemize}

\begin{center}\framebox{\begin{minipage}{.9\linewidth}\textbf{NOTE}

This test will create \texttt{/tmp/lmsbw-test} to hold the
\texttt{mtree} utility.  After testing is complete,
\texttt{/tmp/lmsbw-test} can be deleted.

\end{minipage}}\end{center}


The output of this test is a rough estimate of what the \nullbuild
time should be; to get a better estimate of how long a normal
\nullbuild will take, run this command multiple times to ensure that
the in-RAM disk caches are filled.

In short, the \mtree utility performs a \texttt{stat} on every file in
the named directories and produces output which can be used later to
determine if any file in the directory tree has changed.  When no
files have changed in a source directory, \lmsbw will not recurse into
that directory to build -- modulo other dependency issues which can
force the component's build to be re-invoked.

This means that the elapsed time shown is a very good approximation
for how long a full \nullbuild of the project will take.  Developers
performing incremental builds will greatly benefit by never
recursively building source directories that have not changed.

To see how well \lmsbw fares on a sample build system with tens of
thousands of source files, please see \xref{samples:generate}.

  configuration files} and \emph{\lmsbw startup time}, please refer to
\xref{samples:startup-time}.

\section{How \lmsbw Works}

\lmsbw is not a system that actually builds software; rather, it is a
wrapper for an existing build system that, in most cases, will improve
the prompt-to-prompt incremental build performance of the system in
use now.  \lmsbw can improve an existing system because many build
processes perform altogether too much work when none needs to be
performed; \lmsbw cuts out this unnecessary work by never invoking the
wrapped build when nothing has changed since the last build.

Let's examine the what makes \lmsbw different:

\begin{description}
\item Defined Build Process API

  To facilitate rebuilding dependent components when necessary --
  especially when the exported API of a prerequisite component changes
  -- \lmsbw defines an API that wrapped builds must follow.  This API
  requires that each component install its public build product into a
  \texttt{DESTDIR}.  This facilitates automatic checking of
  inter-component APIs that will force dependent components to be
  rebuilt upon changes to the API.

\item Component Declarations

  \lmsbw automatically generates rules that are used by \make to build
  the project, but to be able to generate these rules, every component
  is the project must be declared to \lmsbw.

  Once declared, \lmsbw takes control of all aspects of each
  component's build: the build directory, the \texttt{DESTDIR}, the
  install directory, and the toolchain to use.  When the component's
  build process is invoked, it only needs to focus on producing a
  build, and, when requested, installing it into the \texttt{DESTDIR}
  directory.

\item Recurse only when needed\label{intro:build-component-criteria}

  \lmsbw only maintains the inter-component dependencies that are
  explicitly defined by the component declarations.

  Intra-component file dependencies are entirely handled by each
  component's build process.  Not handling file dependencies reduces
  memory use and makes the criteria for recursing easier to determine.

  The general determination for building components is this:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item If the component is not built
  \item If \emph{any} file has been changed in the source tree
  \item If \emph{any} file in a prerequisite's declared API has
    changed
  \item If the component's configuration file has changed
  \end{itemize}

  Any of the above conditions being true causes \lmsbw to recurse into
  the component's build process.  Conversely, if \emph{all} of the
  conditions are false, then \lmsbw will \emph{not} recurse into the
  component's build process; not recursing for components that are
  already built saves an amount of time that is proportional to the
  number and complexity of \make rules present in that directory.

\item \makefile Simplicity

  During the execution of the build process, \lmsbw executes, at most,
  three different \makefile processes:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item \lmsbw \makefile

    The first is the main \lmsbw \makefile which handles all the
    configuration and dependencies between components.

  \item Component Trampoline \makefile

    The second \makefile performs configuration such as standard
    macros for the toolchain (\xref{chap:toolchain-usage})
    selected to build the component.

    It also ensures that each component's build process is completely
    disjoint from other components; the settings for \emph{component
      $\alpha$} cannot interfere with the settings for \emph{component
      $\beta$}.

    Because each individual component is fulfilled through a separate
    \make process, this trampoline also ensures that the parallelism
    available through \gnumake is effectively used when it becomes
    necessary to invoke a component's build process.

  \item Component \makefile

    Finally, the \makefile of the component is executed.  This will
    likely already exist if wrapping an existing build process.

    This \makefile will be entered at most twice for each build.  The
    first invocation will be to \emph{build} the component, and the
    second time will be to \emph{install} the component into the
    \destdir.
\end{itemize}

\item Share Build Output

  If the project contains different SKUs, and those SKUs share
  components, \lmsbw is able to share the build output from one SKU
  with another, if the components are compiled exactly the same.

\end{description}

\lmsbw is a lightweight system that has been designed for speeding up
incremental builds.  It handily achieves that goal by performing as
little work as possible from run-to-run.

\section{Steps To Wrap A Build}

The work needed to wrap a build with \lmsbw is directly proportional
to the size of the original build process; a small project will
obviously take less time than a large project, but in both cases the
steps are the same.

\subsection{Configuration File}

A master configuration file for the project must be provided to \lmsbw
on the command line.  The main purpose of the file is to set up the
\lmsbwconfiguration variable~ (\xref{variables:lmsbw-configuration}).

A \gnumake function that will load the component configuration files
(\xref{variables:load-configuration-function}), and an indication of
what \emph{kind} (\xref{variables:kind}) of components the project
will use (\xref{variables:component-build-support}) both must be
provided.

Other fields of \lmsbwconfiguration can be optionally set to further
control the behavior of \lmsbw.
See~\xref{variables:lmsbw-configuration}.

\subsection{Loading Component Configuration}

After loading the command-line-specified master configuration file,
\lmsbw will invoke the component configuration loading function
(\xref{variables:load-configuration-function}).  This function is
responsible for declaring all the components that are to be included
in the project.  Generally there is a one-to-one correspondence of
components to component configuration files.  The called function will
generally load each component configuration file using the \gnumake
\texttt{\$(include)} directive.

The component configuration files are, in fact, \makefile snippets
which can actually have rules that will override the default behavior
of \lmsbw.  See \xref{chap:overriding} for more details on overriding
the default behavior of component building.

This configuration-loading function must ultimately produce two sets
of data:

\begin{itemize}
\item \lmsbwcomponents

  This is a standard \gnumake variable that is a list of all the
  component names which are to be built.

  This variable is internally managed as a by-product of declaring
  components when using the standard declaration functions.

\item \lmsbwcomponent{component}

  Each component loaded is assigned an associative array that holds
  all the data relevant to building the component.

  The keys that are defined for the component's associative array are
  dependent upon the \emph{kind} (\xref{variables:kind}) of the
  component.  For example, a \emph{source} component will define a set
  of keys which would include information such as the source
  directory.  A \emph{download} component would have different keys,
  such as the \texttt{URL} from which the component can be downloaded.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{\lmsbwcomponent{component} Configuration}

Each component's associative array contains data which enables \lmsbw
to build and install it.

Such user-provided data, for a \emph{source} component, includes:

\begin{itemize}
\item source directory
\item prerequisite components
\item brief description
\item reason for building
  \begin{itemize}
  \item built to be delivered in the product
  \item built to be used in the build
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Conveniently, there are \lmsbw functions, such as
\texttt{declare\_source\_component}
(\xref{api:declare-source-component}), which simplify the
configuration of components.

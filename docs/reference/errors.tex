\newcommand{\lmsbwerror}[1]{\section{#1}\label{errors:#1}}

\lmsbwerror{E1000}

\begin{footnotesize}
\begin{verbatim}
E1000: Invalid configuration: 'load-configuration-function' not set
\end{verbatim}
\end{footnotesize}

\lmsbw has been loaded with a configuration file, but the value for
the associative array key ``\texttt{load-configuration-function}'',
has not been set.

See \xref{variables:load-configuration-function} for details on
setting this value.

\lmsbwerror{E1001}

\begin{footnotesize}
\begin{verbatim}
E1001: Invalid configuration: 'load-configuration-function' \
       must be defined in an included Makefile
\end{verbatim}
\end{footnotesize}

The function referenced by the \texttt{load-configuration-function}
value does not exist.  See
\xref{variables:load-configuration-function} for details on properly
setting this value.

\lmsbwerror{E1002}

\begin{footnotesize}
\begin{verbatim}
E1002: Configuration file '<pathname>' redefines component
 '<component>' that is already declared in '<pathname>'
\end{verbatim}
\end{footnotesize}

Each component name must be globally unique to a project.  Two
configuration files declare the same component name.

\lmsbwerror{E1003}

\begin{footnotesize}
\begin{verbatim}
E1003: Reason '<reason>' is not 'build' nor 'image'
\end{verbatim}
\end{footnotesize}

An attempt has been made to use an invalid \texttt{reason}.  See
\xref{variables:reason} for details on the allowed values for this
variable.

\lmsbwerror{E1004}

\begin{footnotesize}
\begin{verbatim}
E1004: Component '<component>' cannot have itself as a prerequisite
\end{verbatim}
\end{footnotesize}

\begin{quote}
  \textbf{I am my own grandfather}

  I married a widow who has a grown-up daughter.  My father, who
  visited us quite often, fell in love with my step-daughter and
  married her.  Hence, my father became my son-in-law and my
  step-daughter became my mother.  Some months later, my wife gave
  birth to a son, who became the brother-in-law of my father, as well
  as my uncle. The wife of my father, my step-daughter, also had a
  son.

\lmsbwerror{E1005}

\begin{footnotesize}
\begin{verbatim}
E1005: No verb '<verb>' for component '<component>'
E1005: Does this component exist?  Use 'lmsbw report'
\end{verbatim}
\end{footnotesize}

An attempt has been made to use a valid \lmsbw verb on a component
that does not exist.

If an invalid verb was used, \lmsbw will report that there is no rule
to make the target.

\lmsbwerror{E1007}

\begin{footnotesize}
\begin{verbatim}
E1007: Component prerequisite path '<component-0> -> \
       (<component> ->)... <component-0>' produces a cycle
\end{verbatim}
\end{footnotesize}

The set of components and their prerequisites in \lmsbw must be a
directed acyclic graph (DAG).  The set of components shown in the
error message produce a graph with a cycle.

Restructure the components so that they form a DAG.

\lmsbwerror{E1008}

\begin{footnotesize}
\begin{verbatim}
E1008: Unknown component '<component>'
\end{verbatim}
\end{footnotesize}

An attempt has been made to use an unknown component.  This will
typically occur when trying to set an attribute or call a component
declaration function on a component which has not yet been declared.

To remedy this situation, always declare components before trying to
change them.

\lmsbwerror{E1009}

\begin{footnotesize}
\begin{verbatim}
E1009: Function '<function>' for component '<component>' not written
\end{verbatim}
\end{footnotesize}

This is an internal error which should only be seen when an extension
to \lmsbw is incomplete.  Internally, \lmsbw will call functions which
are written to specifically process a component of a certain
\emph{kind} (\xref{variables:kind}).  When adding a new component
\emph{kind} to \lmsbw, always implement the necessary functions.  Use
the \emph{source} version of the missing function as a reference on
the function semantics.

\lmsbwerror{E1010}
\begin{footnotesize}
\begin{verbatim}
E1010: No 'component-build-support' configured
\end{verbatim}
\end{footnotesize}

The desired \texttt{component-build-support} has not been specified.
See \xref{variables:component-build-support} for information on how to
set this variable.

\lmsbwerror{E1011}
\begin{footnotesize}
\begin{verbatim}
E1011: Component build type '<type>' is not valid)
\end{verbatim}
\end{footnotesize}

An unsupported value has been specified for
\texttt{component-build-support}.  See
\xref{variables:component-build-support} for information on how to set
this variable.

\lmsbwerror{E1012}
\begin{footnotesize}
\begin{verbatim}
E1012: No component <component>
\end{verbatim}
\end{footnotesize}

When using the \texttt{--prerequisite-check}

\lmsbwerror{E1013}
\begin{footnotesize}
\begin{verbatim}
E1012: 'build' component '<component>' cannot
       depend on 'image' component '<component>'
\end{verbatim}
\end{footnotesize}

\lmsbwerror{E1014}

\begin{footnotesize}
\begin{verbatim}
E1014: The component 'build output download'
       script has not been declared.
\end{verbatim}
\end{footnotesize}

A component has been marked to have its build output downloaded, but
no download script has been declared.

See \xref{variables:component-build-output-download-script} for
information on declaring a build-output download script.

\lmsbwerror{E1015}
\begin{verbatim}
E1015: <pathname>
\end{verbatim}

This error occurs when the declared build-output-download script does
not exist.  \lmsbw cannot proceed until the program declared to
download component build output exists.

See \xref{variables:component-build-output-download-script} for
information on declaring a build-output download script.

\lmsbwerror{E1016}

\begin{verbatim}
E1016: Component '<component>' marked
       'build-output-download', but prerequisite
       '<component>' is not.
\end{verbatim}

A component marked to have its build output downloaded (see
\xref{api:build-output-download}) has prerequisites which will be
built from source; \lmsbw does not allow this.  See
\xref{variables:build-output-download} for the semantics of this
attribute and the reasons why this is disallowed.

\lmsbwerror{E1017}

\begin{verbatim}
E1017: build-output-download configuration failure.
\end{verbatim}

This error follows \texttt{E1016} and is used to halt the build.  This
error means that at least one \texttt{E1016} occurred.

\lmsbwerror{E1018}

\begin{verbatim}
E1018: <pathname>
\end{verbatim}

This error is generated when the file provided to via
\texttt{--configuration} (\xref{usinglmsbw:configuration}) does not
exist.

\lmsbwerror{E1019}

\begin{verbatim}
E1019: <pathname>
\end{verbatim}

This error is produced when the \emph{build support} file name
assigned to \texttt{component-build-support}
(\xref{variables:component-build-support}) does not exist.

\lmsbwerror{E1020}

\begin{verbatim}
E1020: <pathname>
\end{verbatim}

This error is produced when the source directory named, when declaring
a component with \texttt{declare\_source\_component}
(\xref{api:declare-source-component}), does not exist.

\lmsbwerror{E1021}

\begin{verbatim}
E1021: <pathname>
\end{verbatim}

This error is produced when a toolchain that is attempting to be used
does not actually exist.

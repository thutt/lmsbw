\chapter{Variables}

The \lmsbw system uses \gmsl to simplify the implementation of data
structures in \make by using associative arrays as a kind of record
structure.  This facilitates a programming interface that uses few
variables in a uniform way that makes using \lmsbw simple.

This chapter provides a reference for the variables that are used
internally by \lmsbw, and that provide the low-level interface used to
declare and define components\todo{glossary:component, module}.

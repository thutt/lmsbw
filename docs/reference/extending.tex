\chapter{Extending \lmsbw}\label{chap:extending}

\lmsbw has been designed and written to facilitate easy extension by
adding new component \emph{kinds}.  The majority of the work will take
place in the core \texttt{wrapper/engine} directory, but some work may
need to done in \texttt{wrapper/component}.

Extending boils down to performing these steps:

\begin{itemize}
\item Choose component \texttt{kind}

  The new \texttt{kind} should be a single word, all lowercase, and be
  a good mnemonic.

\item Create a report function

  The report generation (\texttt{generate-report.mk}) system generates
  reports for each component based on its \texttt{kind} by calling a
  function named using the component's \texttt{kind} field.  Thus, to
  add a new component \texttt{kind} of \emph{download}, create a
  function called:

\begin{verbatim}
generate_component_report_download
\end{verbatim}

  The function takes one \texttt{LMSBW\_component\_<component>}
  (\xref{variables:lmsbw-component-component}) argument.

  Refer to \texttt{generate\_component\_report\_source} as a
  reference.

\item Create a rule generator function

  Dependency rule generation in \lmsbw is handled by calling a
  function based on the \texttt{kind} of each component.  To add a new
  component \texttt{kind} of \emph{download}, a function must be
  created with the following name:

\begin{verbatim}
generate_component_rules_download
\end{verbatim}

  The function takes one \texttt{LMSBW\_component\_<component>}
  (\xref{variables:lmsbw-component-component}) argument.

  Refer to \texttt{generate\_component\_rules\_source} as a reference.

\item Update \texttt{component.makefile}

  If the new component \texttt{kind} requires the component's build
  process to be invoked for other reasons -- for example, maybe to run
  \texttt{./configure} -- tnen update \texttt{component.makefile} to
  support this new trampoline mode.

\item Update \lmsbwconfiguration

  If the new component \texttt{kind} requires global configuration
  changes, make them using the \lmsbwconfiguration
  (\xref{variables:lmsbw-configuration}) variable.

\item Update documentation

  At the very least, update \xref{chap:variables} and \xref{chap:api}
  to reflect the new additions.

\item Write new tests

  Write new tests to ensure that the changes are correct.

  Update \texttt{lmsbw-run-tests} to incorporate them.

\item Run tests

  The \texttt{lmsbw-run-tests} script should be run.

\item Update \texttt{generate} sample.

  Update the \texttt{generate} sample to incorporate the new component
  \texttt{kind}.

  The new component \texttt{kind} should not be significantly
  different in original build time than the \makefile version.

  The new component \texttt{kind} must not alter the incremental
  speed of \lmsbw.

\item Add new samples

  Add new samples that show how to declare and use the new component
  \texttt{kind}.

\end{itemize}

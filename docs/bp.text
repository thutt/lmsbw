The process used to build software is generally overlooked, and not
paid much attention.  It's almost universally reviled, too.  I've
worked at many places, and one common thread of disgust has been the
build process.  Common complaints include things like: "It's so slow",
"It's hard to understand", "Dependencies are wrong, so incremental
builds don't work correctly."
